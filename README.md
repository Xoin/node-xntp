# node-xntp

node-xntp is complete insanity and shows that even for something as simple as a nttp server you can screw it up with feature bloat and bad practice.

Thing planned are easy addition of database ( or direct connection to APIs) and support as man nttp rfcs as possible so you can set it up for new or old clients.
